## Overview

Working with an existing code base, you will be extending some basic functionality within a subset of the existing Shotlist application. The objective of which is to give your interviewer a glimpse into your experience with SwiftUI and to present you with a common code reorganization problem.

## How to work on this challenge

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/dyashy/ShotlistDevChallenge-iOS`
2. Modify the code locally
3. Create a pull request with your code when ready to submit

## Time

We have given you a set of tasks which should take no more than 10 hours to complete. Although working on this challenge for longer than 10 hours is fine, we will not expect you to do so. If you find yourself having worked the allotted time and have not completed all milestones, you may stop working and write out some notes on what you were tying to accomplish and what you would have liked to do next. We will not evaluate how much you accomplished, but rather would like to understand your thought process and what you spend that time working on.

## Current code

You will be given a SwiftUI project generated with **Xcode 11.6**. The AppDelegate, SceneDelegate and Info.plist files have been left completely stock as well as no external dependencies will be needed for this challenge (although you may pull in external dependencies as you feel necessary). The project's `ContentView.swift` file calls a single `ShootPreview()` view which is the basis of this challenge. Your tasks will be to modify certain of this preview's sub-views in the alloted time.

## Milestones

We are giving you three primary tasks:
1. Create an editable state for the Background text as shown here

2. Add solid lines between the dots on the status bar in such a way that they are responsive to different screen sizes and dot count (shown below)

3. Create a "sticky" header as shown below
